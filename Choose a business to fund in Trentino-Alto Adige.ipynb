The concept of *\"weighted economy centroid\"* is useful to help determine the geolocation of a new hypothetical venue with respect to geographical center of the area, and the most profitable direction in the area. Also *economy centroid* provides an insight of economical unbalance of the region. The more general conclusion is to try and find more economically unbalanced places and fill them with new venues. It's less profitable and more difficult to enter in a well-balanced area.**"
